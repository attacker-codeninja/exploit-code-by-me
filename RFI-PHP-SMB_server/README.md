# Configure SAMBA Server with anonymous browse access 

-> Install SAMB server using below mentioned command:

    apt-get install samba
 
-> Create a SMB share directory (in my case /var/www/html/pub/)
 
    mkdir /var/www/html/pub/
 
 -> Configure permissions on newly created SMB share directory:
 
    chmod 0555 /var/www/html/pub/
    chown -R nobody:nogroup /var/www/html/pub/

Run below mentioned command to remove default content of SAMBA server cofig file

    echo > /etc/samba/smb.conf

-> Put below mentioned content in file '/etc/samba/smb.conf'

    [global]
    workgroup = WORKGROUP
    server string = Samba Server %v
    netbios name = indishell-lab
    security = user
    map to guest = bad user
    name resolve order = bcast host
    dns proxy = no
    bind interfaces only = yes

    [ica]
    path = /var/www/html/pub
    writable = no
    guest ok = yes
    guest only = yes
    read only = yes
    directory mode = 0555
    force user = nobody
    
Now, restart SAMBA server to apply new configuration spcified in config file /etc/samba/smb.conf

    service smbd restart
